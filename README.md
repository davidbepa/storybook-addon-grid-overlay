# storybook-addon-grid-overlay

The Storybook-addon-grid package is a tool that enhances the visual layout of your Storybook stories by providing a grid overlay. It allows you to easily align and position your components within a grid system, making it easier to create clean, consistent designs.

With this package, you can define custom grid settings, such as grid max size, column count, and gutter spacing, and easily toggle the grid overlay on or off while previewing your components in Storybook.
